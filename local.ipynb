The bearing steels are \\n\\\\nworking under dynamic loads in service conditions and their toughness \\nproperties become important. In order to provide the de sired \\\\nmechanical \\nproperties, various heat treatments ( austenizing , quenching  and tempering) \\nare usually applied. In this study, AISI 52100 \\\\nbearing steel samples were \\naustenized  at 900 \\\\u00b0C for \\\\u00bd h and water quenched to room temperature. \\nThen tempering  was carried out at \\\\n795\\\\u00b0C, 400\\\\u00b0C  and 200 \\\\u00b0C \\nfor \\\\u00bd h. In order t o investigate the effect of heat treatment conditions \\non wear behavior , dry friction tests were \\\\nperformed according to ASTM G99 -\\n05 Standard  with a \\\\u2018ball -on-disk \\\\u2019 type tribometer. The samples \\nwere tested against steel and ceramic \\\\ncounterparts using the para meters of \\n100 m distance and 30 N load and 0.063 m/s  rotational speed. After wear \\ntest,  the surface  \\\\ncharacterization was carried out using microscopy. Wear \\nloss values were calculated using a novel optical method on both flat and \\n\\\\ncounterpart specimens.  \\\\n \\\\nKeywords:  Wear resistant alloys , Bearing \\nsteel, Tribology, Microscopy , Characterization   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1. \\nIntroduction  \\\\n \\\\nToday, the bearing steels are used as one of the key \\n\\\\ncomponents in design and manufacturing of various machinery \\\\nparts.

The matrices of \\\\nthese groups of steel alloys are \\npreferably transformed to martensite after quenching in suitable media , e.g. \\noil or salt. Due \\\\nto the relatively high alloy elements and carbon content, \\n\\\\nmartensitic matrices need to be tempered to suppress the excess \\n\\\\nbrittleness. Hardenability depth is another important key factor, \\n\\\\nparticularly for those steel parts, which possess relatively large \\\\ncross -\\nsectional area. When this depth value is not sufficient at \\\\ngiven dimensions \\nof bearing steel part, the case hardening \\\\ntreatment or increasing alloy \\ncontent can be introduced [1,3].  \\\\nThe spheroidization  treatment plays a \\ncritical role in  the \\\\nmanufacturing  process of this sort of hypereutectoid \\nsteels. \\\\nBecause proeutectoid  cementite can easily be formed at prior \\n\\\\naustenite grain boundaries on cooling, and hence resulting an', metadata={'source': 'hackmet.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

Thus the present \\nresearch endeavor is one such attempt  to study \\\\nthe effect of heat treatment \\non the mechanical properties of AISI 52100 alloy steel.

The tests are conducted as per ASTM \\\\nstandards.  It is \\nobserved that the as -received AISI samples possess high  carbide content \\n\\\\nwhich makes them hard, whereas the tempering reduces the carbide content \\nindicating less \\\\nhardness. The impact tests revealed that the impact strength \\nof the tempered samples \\\\nincreased when compared to the as -received \\nspecimens. Moreover,  approximately 50 \\\\u201360% \\\\nwear resistance was \\nimproved with tempering of AISI steel . However,  the elasticity and \\n\\\\nDuctility values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is typical of \\ntool steels of this \\\\nclass.

These phases possibly are decomposition products \\nlike ferrite & cem entite or may be \\\\nsuper saturated solid solutions. The \\nfactors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing \\\\nbetween ferrite and \\ncementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance \\\\nof \\nsteels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between \\nferrite and cementite \\\\nbeing large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, \\nthereby increasing ductility. This is \\\\nattainable by slow cooling of the \\naustenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the \\\\ntreatment is known as \\nannealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster \\n\\\\nrate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be \\navailable to form finer \\\\npearlite with increase in weight percentage of \\neutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of \\\\ntreatmen t is known as \\nnormalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and \\\\ncementite \\nin pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The \\n\\\\nnormalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of \\nproeutectoid ferrite.  If \\\\nthe austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that \\nthe cooling rate is greater than or equal to \\\\ncritical cooling rate (CCR), \\nthe transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated \\\\nsingle \\nphase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got \\na c/a \\\\nratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is \\nincrease in hardness and \\\\nstrength with considerable amount of thermal \\nstresses because of quenching severity.

The data clearly \\\\nshows a decrease in hardness with increase in \\ntempering temperature. V ariation of hardness \\\\nagainst tempering temperature \\nfor each heat treatment sequence is shown in Figure 5. As \\\\ntempering \\ntemperature increases, hardness then gradually decreases. It has been a \\ngeneral \\\\nobservation for steels that hardness decreases with highe r \\ntempering temperatures. However, \\\\nthe increasing -decreasing trend seen here \\nfor AISI 52100 steel is in line with typical behavior \\\\nof high -strength hot \\n-work tool steels, especially H -category steels [16]. For all the cases the \\n\\\\nhardness values are quite clo se to each other, indicating that difference \\nin heat treatment \\\\nsequence does not have a significant effect on \\nhardness.  The decrease in hardness is due to \\\\ndecrease in c/a ratio of \\nmartensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness \\\\nshows the ina \\ndequate tempering duration which is 1 hour. This is due to the relaxation of \\nthe \\\\nBCT martensitic cell i.e. the drastic reduction in c/a ratio of \\nmartensite. Figure 6 shows that \\\\nwith an increase in tempering temperature, \\nimpact toughness increases. The maxi mum value \\\\nfor impact toughness was \\nobserved at tempering temperature of 550 0C which construes the \\\\nfact that \\nhigh tempering  temperatures play a dominant role in behavior of impact \\ntoughness \\\\nwhile compared to lower tempering temperatures. Th e average wear \\nv olume loss of heat \\\\ntreated samples with respect to time in dry sliding \\ntest is presented in Figure 7. The bar graph \\\\nclearly indicates that as the \\ntempering temperature increases, the wear volume loss gradually \\\\ndecreases. \\nThe as-received specimen had consid erable amount of burr formation at the end \\n\\\\nwhich was kept on the tungsten disc. This indicates that a lot of heat was \\nformed at the end \\\\nwhich deformed the portion of that end plastically.

The Ductility suddenly increases as \\ntempering temperature \\\\nincre ases up to 2500C, and then starts to decrease \\nrather sharply at 3500 C. This decreasing - \\\\nincreasing trend of ductility \\nvariation is typical of steels of this class. A huge difference exists \\n\\\\nbetween the ductility values for as -received and 2500C tempered specimen. \\nEven though a \\\\nhuge difference is existing in these values for as -bought, \\ntempered specimens, the fracture \\\\nbehavior of hardened specimen is totally \\ndifferent [17, 18]. This is the evidence for the \\\\nformation of brittle \\nsupersaturated sol id solution of martensite. This also justifies that the as \\n-\\\\nbought specimen is hot worked.

INTRODUCTION  \\\\n Steels can be subjected to  variety of \\nconventional heat treatments like normalizing, \\\\nhardening and tempering. Th e \\nknowledge of materials and their properties is of great \\\\nimportance for a \\nproduction engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with \\\\nmaterials \\nthat possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating \\nconditions.  For \\\\nexample, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which \\nachieves a high degree of hardness \\\\nwith compressive strength and abrasion \\nresistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning \", \\n    \"page_3\" : \"tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the \\nrequired properties heat treatment \\\\nmethods are commonly used. The combined \\neffect of heating and cooling operations \\\\nperformed in a metal or alloy in \\nthe solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high \\\\ntemperature austenite \\nphase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room \\n\\\\ntemperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending \\nupon cooling cycle \\\\n[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products \\nlike ferrite & cem entite or may be \\\\nsuper saturated solid solutions. The \\nfactors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing \\\\nbetween ferrite and \\ncementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance \\\\nof \\nsteels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between \\nferrite and cementite \\\\nbeing large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, \\nthereby increasing ductility. This is \\\\nattainable by slow cooling of the \\naustenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the \\\\ntreatment is known as \\nannealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster \\n\\\\nrate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be \\navailable to form finer \\\\npearlite with increase in weight percentage of \\neutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of \\\\ntreatmen t is known as \\nnormalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and \\\\ncementite \\nin pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The \\n\\\\nnormalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of \\nproeutectoid ferrite.  If \\\\nthe austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that \\nthe cooling rate is greater than or equal to \\\\ncritical cooling rate (CCR), \\nthe transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated \\\\nsingle \\nphase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got \\na c/a \\\\nratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is \\nincrease in hardness and \\\\nstrength with considerable amount of thermal \\nstresses because of quenching severity. To \\\\ndecrease the c/a ratio of BCT \\nmartensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite \\\\ninto stable \\nphases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to \\nminimize \\\\nthe thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment', metadata={'source': 'hackmet.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='is given. Depending upon \\\\nthe tempering tempe rature and duration, the \\nimprovement in toughness is achievable with the \\\\nsacrifice of hardness and \\nstrength. Because of high brittleness, as quenched spring steels are \\\\nseldom \\nused for practical applications [12, 13]. By tempering process, the properties \\nof  \\\\nquenched steel could be modified to improve its impact resistance. Amid \\ntempering, the \\\\nresulting microstructure contains bainite or epsilon carbide \\nin a matrix of ferrite depending on \\\\nthe tempering temperature.   \\\\nMandal et \\nal. [12] investigated the in fluence of austempering on the mechanical \\n\\\\nproperties and microstructure of silicon alloyed cast steel. The \\nexperimental results showed \", \\n    \"page_4\" : \"that, ausferrite structure consisting of bainitic ferrite and \\naustenite could be retained by \\\\naustempering the steel for dif ferent \\naustempering temperature. MacIejewski and Regulski \\\\n[13] conducted studies on \\nthe fracture assessment of martempered, quenched and tempered \\\\nAISI 4140 low \\nalloy steel. It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include \\nless \\\\ndistortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved \\nimpact energy. Lerner \\\\nand Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive \\nwear experiments on Austempered \\\\nDuctile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the \\npotential applications of this material for wear \\\\nparts , as an alternative \\nto steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI \\n\\\\npossessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -\\nfriction coefficient \\\\nand could be potentially used for dry sliding wear \\napplications. In abrasiv e wear mode, the \\\\nwear rate of ADI was comparable to \\nthat of alloyed hardened AISI 4340 steel, and relatively \\\\none-half that of \\nhardened medium carbon AISI 1050 steel. Jetley [15] reported improvement \\\\nin \\ntribological characters of aircra ft brake steel rotors  by Martempering. \\nMartempering \\\\nprocess was done by oil - and water -based quench ants at lower \\ntemperature. The samples \\\\nwere tested for hardness, distortion, and wear. The \\nresults showed that both hardness and \\\\nwear resistances were lower when \\ncompared to the  austempering, and also met the design \\\\nintent. However, to \\nthe best of the authors \\\\u2019 observations, there have been few reports on \\n\\\\ntempering behavior of AISI 52100. The objective of the present study is to \\ninvestigate the \\\\neffect of the tempering on the micro structure and \\nmechanical properties of AISI 52100, \\\\nproviding reference for its various \\nindustrial applications.  \\\\n2.

INTRODUCTION  \\\\n Steels can be subjected to  variety of \\nconventional heat treatments like normalizing, \\\\nhardening and tempering. Th e \\nknowledge of materials and their properties is of great \\\\nimportance for a \\nproduction engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with \\\\nmaterials \\nthat possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating \\nconditions.  For \\\\nexample, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which \\nachieves a high degree of hardness \\\\nwith compressive strength and abrasion \\nresistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning \", \\n    \"page_3\" : \"tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the \\nrequired properties heat treatment \\\\nmethods are commonly used. The combined \\neffect of heating and cooling operations \\\\nperformed in a metal or alloy in \\nthe solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high \\\\ntemperature austenite \\nphase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room \\n\\\\ntemperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending \\nupon cooling cycle \\\\n[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products \\nlike ferrite & cem entite or may be \\\\nsuper saturated solid solutions. The \\nfactors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing \\\\nbetween ferrite and \\ncementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance \\\\nof \\nsteels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between \\nferrite and cementite \\\\nbeing large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, \\nthereby increasing ductility. This is \\\\nattainable by slow cooling of the \\naustenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the \\\\ntreatment is known as \\nannealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster \\n\\\\nrate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be \\navailable to form finer \\\\npearlite with increase in weight percentage of \\neutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of \\\\ntreatmen t is known as \\nnormalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and \\\\ncementite \\nin pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The \\n\\\\nnormalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of \\nproeutectoid ferrite.  If \\\\nthe austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that \\nthe cooling rate is greater than or equal to \\\\ncritical cooling rate (CCR), \\nthe transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated \\\\nsingle \\nphase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got \\na c/a \\\\nratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is \\nincrease in hardness and \\\\nstrength with considerable amount of thermal \\nstresses because of quenching severity. To \\\\ndecrease the c/a ratio of BCT \\nmartensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite \\\\ninto stable \\nphases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to \\nminimize \\\\nthe thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment \\nis given. Depending upon \\\\nthe tempering tempe rature and duration, the \\nimprovement in toughness is achievable with the \\\\nsacrifice of hardness and \\nstrength.

It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include \\nless \\\\ndistortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved \\nimpact energy. Lerner \\\\nand Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive \\nwear experiments on Austempered \\\\nDuctile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the \\npotential applications of this material for wear \\\\nparts , as an alternative \\nto steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI \\n\\\\npossessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -\\nfriction coefficient \\\\nand could be potentially used for dry sliding wear \\napplications.

The decrease in hardness is due to \\\\ndecrease in c/a ratio of \\nmartensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness \\\\nshows the ina \\ndequate tempering duration which is 1 hour.

Because \\\\ntempering can change the morphology of \\nmartensite and other \\\\nstructure characteristics derived from martensite \\ntransformation, \\\\nsome of the mechanical properties of DP steel are sensitive \\nto the\\\\ntempering process. \\\\nThe microstructure evolution and changes in \\nstrength and \\\\nplasticity of heat treatment DP steel during tempering have \\nbeen\\\\nfully investigated through the isothermal tempering treatment \\n[5\\\\u2013\\\\n 9]. Chang [5]summarized that the microstructure exhibiteddifferent \\ncharacteristics under the four isothermal tempering re- \\\\ngimes: below 225 \\n\\\\u00b0C, 225 \\\\u2013350 \\\\u00b0C, 350 \\\\u2013535 \\\\u00b0C and above 535 \\n\\\\u00b0C,\\\\nrespectively. Kuang [6]illustrated that the microstructure evolu-\\n\\\\ntion of DP steel during tempering included three stages: the relief \\\\nof \\nresidual stress, the precipitation of carbides in both ferrite \\nand\\\\nmartensite, and the dissolution of carbides in the ferrite. At \\nthe\\\\nhigher tempering temperature (above 300 \\\\u00b0C), both tensile \\\\nstrength \\nand yield strength decreased, which was opposite to the \\\\nelongation. When the \\ntempering temperature lowered than \\\\n200 \\\\u00b0C, the changes in mechanical \\nproperties highly depended on \\\\nthe tempering temperature and time. Except for \\ntensile properties, \\\\nfew studies focused on the effects of tempering on \\nimpact\\\\ntoughness of DP steel. It is clear that the tempering of \\nmartensite \\\\nreadily occurs in steels with lean chemical compositions, particu-\\n\\\\nlarly when the martensite forms near the martensite start tem- \\\\nperature ( \\nM\\\\ns)[10,11]. Currently, the tempering of DP steels re- \\\\nported in previous \\nstudies mainly stems from the reheating off-line, and few papers consider the \\ntempering behavior occurred on \\\\nhot rolling line.

It is \\\\nknown \\nthat the continuous yielding of dual phase steel was mainly \\\\nattributed to the \\nmobile dislocations produced by martensitetransformation at low temperature \\n[1,7,19,20], for example in \\\\nFig. 3 a. Dislocations, one of structure defects \\nin crystalline solid \\\\nsolutions, are disturbed regions with low \\nthermodynamically \\\\nstability, and attract solute segregation when diffusion is \\nenable[21 \\\\u201323]. Therefore, when the coiling temperature increased to \\\\n260 \\n\\\\u00b0C, C and N atoms was considered to diffuse to the dislocations \\\\nand \\npinned them. Many researches had also demonstrated thatthe interstitial atoms \\nof C and N could segregate and pin the dis-locations when the tempering \\ntemperature increased to /C24250 \\\\u00b0C,\\\\nleading to the rise in yield \\nstrength and the appearance of yield \\\\nplatform [7 \\\\u20139,19,23]. In this \\nstudy, the yield plateau and the sig- \\\\nni\\\\ufb01cantly increase in yield \\nstrength, to some extent, revealed that \\\\ninterstitial atoms of C and N \\nsegregated and pinned the disloca- \\\\ntions during auto-tempering. \\\\nAs listed in \\nTable, 1 , steel CT1 was characterized by high tensile \\\\nstrength and strong \\nstrain hardening ability, which attributed to \\\\nthe high hardness of quenched \\nmartensite [24 \\\\u201326]. For steel CT2, \\\\nthe tensile strength decreased \\ndistinctly due to the softening ofmartensite. The reduction of hardness \\ndifference between ferriteand martensite caused by auto-tempering resulted in \\nthe decrease \\\\nof strain hardening ability [24,25]. When the coiling \\ntemperature \\\\nincreased from 150 \\\\u00b0C to 260 \\\\u00b0C, the uniform elongation \\ndecreased \\\\nfrom 16.5% to 13%, which demonstrated that the auto-\\ntempering \\\\nstimulated the occurrence of necking. It is known that the \\nnecking \\\\nappears when the strain hardening rate ( ds/d \\\\n\\\\u03b5 ) is equal or \\nless\\\\nthan the true stress ( s)[27], and the corresponding strain is \\nthe\\\\nuniform strain ( \\\\u03b5u), shown in Fig. 5 . Thus, the increase of \\nstrain\\\\nhardening rate or the decrease of true stress can postpone \\nthe\\\\noccurrence of necking. After auto-tempering, both the strain \\\\nhardening \\nrate and the true stress reduced, but the degree of the \\\\nformer was more \\nprominent. Therefore, the auto-tempering ac- \\\\ncelerated the occurrence of \\nnecking. Nevertheless, the stress-strain \\\\ncurve of steel CT2 had a distinct \\nnecking stage ( Fig. 4 ), and the \\\\npost-necking elongation and reduction of \\narea reached 23.5% and \\\\n86%, respectively, higher than that of steel CT1.

In this \\nregard, \\\\none of the ways to improve the strength of austenitic stainless \\nsteels is \\\\nthe addition of alloying elements such as nitrogen which \\nincreases \\\\ntensile and yield strength with the expense of their ductility \\nand\\\\nformability [8]. Another e \\\\ufb00ective way is the grain re \\\\ufb01nement \\nwhich\\\\nincreases the strength and toughness without impairing ductility[9,10] \\n. The commonly used techniques for grain re \\\\ufb01nement are based \\\\non two di \\n\\\\ufb00erent approaches: severe plastic deformation (SPD) [11] andadvanced \\nthermomechanical processing (ATMP) [12]. During severe \\\\nplastic deformation, a \\nvery high levels of plastic strain is imposed on \\\\nsample through repetitive \\nprocessing and the grain re \\\\ufb01nement is \\\\nachieved by the mechanism similar \\nto continuous dynamic re-crystallization where the grain boundaries are \\ndeveloped from dis- \\\\nlocation cells as a result of the extended recovery and \\nincrease of the \\\\nmisorientation angle with continued straining [13]. The main \\ndraw-\\\\nbacks of SPD techniques are the batch nature of these processes and \\nalsothe small dimensions of processed samples which make them suitable \\\\nfor \\nthe synthesis of the laboratory scale samples instead of the industrial \\\\nscale \\nproduction of ultra \\\\ufb01ne grained and nanostructured steels. In \\\\ncontrast \\nwith SPD processing, the advanced thermomechanical pro-cesses can be performed \\nin industrial scale to produce ultra \\\\ufb01ne grained \\\\nsteels products such as \\nsheets and strips.

Microstructural \\nevolution during cold rolling \\\\nIt is well known that the cross slip of \\ndislocations in face centered \\\\ncubic (FCC) materials become di \\\\ufb03cult with \\ndecreasing stacking fault \\\\nenergy [25]. Austenitic stainless steels are among \\nthe low stacking fault \\\\nenergy materials and their microstructures are prone \\nto dynamic re- \\\\ncrystallization when deforming at high temperatures [26]. \\nAlso, the low \\\\ntemperature deformation of austenitic stainless steels such as \\ncoldrolling is accompanied by the formation of deformation induced twins \\\\nand \\nsubsequent austenite to martensite transformation [27]. In this \\\\nclass of \\nmaterials, mechanical twins are formed as a result of the suc-cessive \\naccumulation of stacking faults on the {111} slip planes. But, \\\\nthe \\n\\\\u03b5martensite is formed due to the alternative pile up of stacking \\\\nfaults. \\nThe stacking fault energy (SFE) of austenitic stainless steels canbe evaluated \\nusing the following expression [28]: \\\\n\\\\u239b\\\\n\\\\u239d\\\\u239e\\\\u23a0 =\\\\u2212 + \\n\\\\u2212 \\\\u2212 + SFEmJ \\\\nmCr Ni Mn Mo 53 0.7(% ) 6.2(% ) 3.2(% ) 9.3(% \\n)\\\\n2\\\\nAccording to the above equation, the SFE of the investigated aus-\\n\\\\ntenitic stainless steel is calculated to be 22 mJ/m2. If the SFE of aus-\\n\\\\ntenitic stainless steel is higher than 20 mJ/m2, the \\\\u03b5martensite is \\nnot\\\\nformed during cold deformation. In this case, intersected \\nmechanical \\\\ntwins are formed at lower strains and the \\\\u03b1\\\\u0301 martensite \\nis developed at \\\\nhigher imposed strains mainly in the intersected regions of \\ntwinboundaries. In contrast, when the SFE is lower than 20 mJ/m \\\\n2, the \\n\\\\u03b5\\\\n martensite is formed at initial stage of cold deformation and the \\n\\\\u03b1\\\\u0301\\\\n martensite is developed with further straining [28]. It is \\nconcluded that \\\\nthe \\\\u03b5martensite is not formed during deformation of the \\ninvestigated \\\\nsteel because the SFE value is higher than 20 mJ/m2.Fig. 3 shows \\nthe\\\\nmicrostructure of AISI 321 steel after cold rolling with 80% \\nreduction. \\\\nIn this optical micrograph the dark regions contain shear \\nbands,Table 1 \\\\nChemical composition of as received AISI 321 austenitic \\nstainless steel (%wt.). \\\\nCS i M n C r N i M o T i NF e \\\\n0.036 0.421 1.910 \\n17.154 8.620 0.374 0.303 0.013 Bal. \\\\nFig. 1.

Introduction \\\\nThe increasing demand for weight reduction \\nwith high safety performance in the automotive \\\\nindustry has led to the \\ncontinuous development of advanced high strength steels (AHSS), such as \\\\ndual-\\nphase (DP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels [ 1 \\\\u20134]. \\nCompared to other \\\\nhigh-strength steel grades, DP steels involve a leaner \\nalloy addition and can be produced using \\\\nwell-adapted processes, while they \\nshow attractive balance between strength and formability [ \\n5\\\\u20138].\\\\nHowever, the new wave of fuel-economy regulations demands better \\ncombination between strength \\\\nand ductility/toughness, so that the stringent \\ndesign requirements can be met. One of the promising \\\\napproaches achieving \\nthis desire is to produce DP steels with ultra \\\\ufb01ne grain size. It has been \\nwell\\\\nknown that grain re \\\\ufb01nement of DP steels leads to huge strength \\nenhancement without apparent \\\\nsacri\\\\ufb01ce of plasticity [ 9 \\\\u201320]. While, \\nsingle-phase UFG materials usually show high strength but limited \\\\nductility [ \\n19]. Previous studies [ 16] attributed the bene \\\\ufb01ts of UFG-DP to \\noptimizations of strain \\\\nhardening rate, martensite plasticity and interface \\ncohesion. A better understanding of the grain \\\\nre\\\\ufb01nement is worthy to be \\nstudied further to optimize mechanical properties of UFG-DP steels. \\\\nHowever, \\nthe successful production of UFG-DP remains a challenge, which relies on \\nstarting \\\\nwith the fine-scale microstructure and maintaining the structural \\nscale during intercritical annealing. \\\\nThe fine-scale initial microstructures', metadata={'source': 'hackmet.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",

In addition, fast heating \\nduring intercritical annealing was found \\\\nto be important to maintain the \\nultrafine grain size, which is allowed by the pinning of ferrite \\ngrain\\\\nboundaries by the formation of austenite islands [ 6,7,24 \\\\u201326].

The \\\\ufb01brous\\\\nDP and the UFG-DP have different \\nmartensite volume fractions. Figure 4d also shows that increasing \\\\nthe \\nannealing temperature did not result in a larger ferrite grain size. During \\nintercritically annealing \\\\nthe microstructure as shown in Figure 3b, the \\naustenite phase preferably forms from the existing \\\\ncarbon-rich martensite \\nislands. The amount of austenite phase is increased at a higher \\nannealing \\\\ntemperature, which is indicated by the evolution of martensite \\nvolume fraction after quenching. On the \\\\nother hand, the driving force to \\nrecrystallization and grain growth of ferrite is large due to the heavy \\\\ncold-\\nrolling. The dispersion of easily formed austenite dispersions acts as \\nef\\\\ufb01cient pinning points to \\\\nthe migration of ferrite grain boundaries, \\nwhich results in the fact that the \\\\ufb01ne scale of the structure \\\\nsurvived \\nafter the heat treatment. However, the recrystallization of ferrite is not \\nfully suppressed, \\\\nwhich explains the equiaxed ferrite grain shape. Moreover, \\nas shown in the Figure 5, low-density \\\\nof precipitations are observed in some \\nferrite grains. This could be explained by the procedure of \\\\nthe heat \\ntreatment. The intercritical annealing was performed on the \\nferrite \\\\u2013martensite mixture, \\\\nwhere the Carbon is mainly in solute and \\nconcentrated in the martensite phase.

Figure 7b \\nshows the true \\\\nstress-strain curves and the corresponding evolution of strain \\nhardening rate of the UFG-DP steels. \\\\nAll the UFG-DP steels show a high strain \\nhardening rate in the initial stages of the deformation, which \\\\ndecreases \\ngradually with strain. This salient strain hardening behavior enables the DP \\nsteels to possess \\\\na low yield ratio, high tensile strength and relatively \\nhigh uniform elongation. As compared to the \\\\n\\\\ufb01 brous DP steels, the UFG-DP \\nsteels present both higher yield strength and tensile strength (Figure \\n7c).\\\\nThis could be attributed to the reduced ferrite grain size in UFG-DP . \\nThe ferrite in \\\\ufb01brous DP and \\\\nin UFG-DP could behave differently. In a \\ncertain sense, the structural scale of ferrite in \\\\ufb01brous DP \\\\nis also in \\nUFG regime in that the thickness of the ferrite lamella is about 2 \\\\u0016m. \\nHowever, the free \\\\npath of dislocations along the length of the ferrite \\nlamella could be rather large (tens of microns, \\\\ncomparable with the prior \\naustenite grain size), resulting in a large effective ferrite grain size. \\nIndeed, \\\\nthe yield strength of \\\\ufb01brous DP steel is lower than the UFG-DP \\nsteels. In addition, although the size of \\\\nmarteniste islands is also reduced \\nin UFG-DP , this is presumably not contributing to the increase \\nin\\\\nmartensitic strength because the main metallurgical factor determining the \\nstrength of martensite is \\\\ncarbon content [31]. \\\\nMoreover, according to Figure \\n7d, the uniform elongation (UE) of the UFG-DP1, 2 and 3 steel \\\\n(samples after \\nthe \\\\ufb01nal intercritical annealing at 780, 800 and 820 \\\\u000eC for 1.5 min.) \\nis decreased with \\\\nincreasing annealing temperature. When the annealing \\ntemperature is increased, the martensite \\\\nvolume fraction ( Vm) is increased \\nwhile the ferrite grain size (d f) is reduced (Figure 4d).

Due \\\\nto the economic and ecological c onsiderations, the \\nreduction \\\\nin mass is desired. Dual-phase (DP) steel is low-carbon and \\\\nlow-\\nalloy steel with (10 \\\\u201330) v ol% of martensite and a ductile \\\\nferrite \\nmatrix, which is widely used in the automotiveindustry because of the good co \\nmbination of high strength \\\\nand good formability at low production costs [ \\n1\\\\u20134].\\\\nDP steel is characterized by a continuous yielding \\\\nbehavior with \\na low initial \\\\ufb02ow stress and a high initial \\\\nstrain-hardening rate [ \\n5\\\\u20138].
